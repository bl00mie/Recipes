# Pumpkin Cheesecake Casserole
### (Crust + Cheesecake baked together, chilled pumpkin mousse on top)

### Pan
- **9×13 inch ceramic or Pyrex baking dish**

---

### Ingredients
---
### Crust (scaled 1.5×)
- 1 1/2 cups finely crushed [[pecans]]
- 3/4 cup [[almond flour]]
- 1/2 cup [[allulose]]
- 3/4 tsp [[cinnamon]]
- pinch [[salt]]
- 3/4 cup melted [[butter]]

### Cheesecake Layer (scaled 1.5×)
- 12 oz softened [[cream cheese]]
- 3/8 cup (6 tbsp) [[allulose]]
- 1 1/2 [[eggs]] (use 1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk)
- 3 tbsp [[heavy cream]]
- 1 1/2 tsp [[vanilla extract]]

### Pumpkin Mousse Layer (scaled 1.5×)
- 1 1/2 cups [[pumpkin puree]]
- 3/4 cup [[allulose]]
- 4–5 [[egg yolks]] (3 × 1.5 ≈ 4.5)
- 1 1/2 packets [[gelatin]] bloomed in 3 tbsp cold water
- 1 1/2 tsp [[cinnamon]]
- 3/4 tsp [[ginger]]
- 3/8 tsp [[nutmeg]]
- 3 tbsp [[brown butter]] (cooled)
- 5 [[egg whites]], whipped to stiff peaks with 3 tbsp allulose folded in

### Directions
1. **Crust:** Mix crushed pecans, almond flour, allulose, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in melted butter. Press firmly into the bottom of a greased 9×13 dish.
2. **Add cheesecake layer:** Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add allulose, egg + yolk, heavy cream, and vanilla; beat until silky. Pour evenly over the unbaked crust.
3. **Bake:** 325°F for **22–28 minutes**, or until cheesecake is just set with a slight wobble. Do not overbake.
4. **Cool completely:** Let reach room temp, then refrigerate until cold.
5. **Prepare pumpkin mousse:**  
   a. Bloom gelatin in 3 tbsp cold water.  
   b. In a saucepan, whisk pumpkin, allulose, yolks, and spices. Gently heat until warm, smooth, and slightly thickened.  
   c. Stir in bloomed gelatin until dissolved. Remove from heat; add brown butter.  
   d. Cool mixture to lukewarm.
6. **Whip egg whites:** Beat to stiff peaks with 3 tbsp allulose. Gently fold whites into cooled pumpkin mixture.
7. **Final assembly:** Spread pumpkin mousse evenly over the cold cheesecake layer.
8. **Chill:** Refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours—overnight is best for clean slicing.

### Notes
- Using allulose ensures the mousse stays soft and creamy with no crystallization.  
- Add a drop of maple extract to the crust for graham-cracker nostalgia.  
- For an extra-thick mousse layer, scale pumpkin mixture to **2×** instead.  
- Freezes perfectly in slices wrapped individually.
