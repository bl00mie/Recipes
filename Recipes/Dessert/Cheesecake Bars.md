### Ingredients
---
- 1/3 cup [[butter]], melted
- 2 cup [[Almond Flour]]
- 1 tsp [[vanilla extract]]
- 1 tbsp [[Monk Fruit Allulose Blend]]

- 1 tsp [[vanilla extract]]
- 1 tbsp [[lemon juice]]
---
### Directions
0. Preheat the oven to 350 F
#### Crust
1. Line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper.
2. Mix [[Almond Flour]] and sweetner in a large bowl.
3. Add [[vanilla extract]] and melted [[butter]] and mix well
4. Press the mixture into the baking sheet.
#### Cheesecake
1. Add all ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix until smooth and even.
2. Pour over the crust and spread evenly with a spatula
3. Bake at 350 F for 40-45 minutes until the filling is set, but is still a little jiggly in the center
4. Allow to cool to room temperature slowly. I usually turn off the oven and leave the door partly ajar. Cooling too quickly can cause the surface to split.
5. After cooling, put it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours prior to serving. 

### Notes
- This is GREAT with some reduced berries swirled in, notably blueberry, raspberry, or blackberry (or a combination!)
