### Ingredients
---
**Bottom layer (strawberry chunks)**
- 2 boxes (0.3 oz / 8.5 g each) [[sugar free strawberry gelatin]]
- 2 cups (480 g) boiling water
- 1 cup (240 g) cold water
- 1 1/2 cups (225 g) [[strawberries]] (chopped small)

**“Creamy” layer (whipped-cream jello)**
- 1 box (0.3 oz / 8.5 g) [[sugar free strawberry gelatin]]
- 1 cup (240 g) boiling water
- 1/2 cup (120 g) cold water
- 1 1/2 cups (360 g) [[heavy cream]] (cold)
- 2–3 tbsp [[powdered monkfruit sweetener]] (to taste)
- 1 tsp [[vanilla extract]]
- Pinch [[kosher salt]]

**For the pan**
- Neutral oil spray (very light) *or* a quick wipe of neutral oil

### Directions
1. **Prep the mold.** Very lightly grease a bundt/Jello mold (too much oil leaves marks). Set in the fridge so it’s cold.
2. **Make the strawberry-chunk layer.** In a bowl, dissolve **2 boxes** sugar-free strawberry gelatin in **2 cups boiling water**, stirring 2 minutes. Stir in **1 cup cold water**. Let cool on the counter **10–15 minutes** (you want it cool but still liquid).
3. **Add strawberries at the right time.** When the gelatin is the consistency of unset egg whites (slightly thickened), stir in chopped [[strawberries]]. Pour into the cold mold. Refrigerate **45–60 minutes** until mostly set (firm enough that a spoon barely dents it).
4. **Make the creamy layer gelatin base.** Dissolve **1 box** gelatin in **1 cup boiling water**. Stir 2 minutes. Stir in **1/2 cup cold water**. Let it cool **15–20 minutes** until room temp (important—warm gelatin will melt your whipped cream).
5. **Whip the cream.** In a cold bowl, whip [[heavy cream]] with [[powdered monkfruit sweetener]], [[vanilla extract]], and a pinch of salt to **medium peaks** (soft but holds shape).
6. **Temper, then fold (prevents lumps).** Whisk 2–3 tbsp of the cooled gelatin into the whipped cream first, then pour in the rest in a thin stream while gently folding. Fold until uniform pink and fluffy.
7. **Layer it.** Spoon the creamy mixture over the mostly-set strawberry layer. Smooth the top. Refrigerate **at least 4 hours**, ideally overnight.
8. **Unmold.** Dip the mold bottom in warm (not hot) water for **10–15 seconds**. Run a thin silicone spatula around the edge. Invert onto a plate and lift the mold off. Slice and serve.

### Notes
- **Critical timing:** If you add strawberries too early, they float. Add them when the gelatin has cooled and thickened slightly.
- **Cool gelatin before folding:** If the gelatin mixture feels warm, wait. Warm gelatin will deflate/melt the whipped cream.
- **Strawberry amount controls carbs:** You can drop to **1 cup strawberries** total for lower net carbs, or go up to **2 cups** for stronger nostalgia.
- **More “Cool Whip” vibe:** Swap vanilla for **1/2 tsp almond extract**, or add 2 tbsp [[cream cheese]] (softened) to the whipped cream before folding for a slightly tangy, stabilized layer.
- **If unmolding is stressful:** Make it in a 9x13 pan and serve as squares (same layers, easier life).
