# Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Line a mini muffin pan with 24 cupcake liners.

2. Make the cornbread batter according to the directions here - but use the ingredient amounts above. (These keto corndog muffins use the same batter as this link, but we're essentially making 1/3 the amount - use the full amounts of the ingredients above.)

3. Transfer the batter evenly into the lined mini muffin pan, filling each cup about 2/3 full.

4. Cut each hot dog into 6 even pieces (totaling 24). Insert one cut hot dog piece into the center of each mini muffin.

5. Bake for 12-14 minutes until the top is golden brown.

# Notes
12 minutes was too long, set a timer at 10 and check.
