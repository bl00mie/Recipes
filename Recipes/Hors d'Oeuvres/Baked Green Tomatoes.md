### Ingredients
---
- 3 medium [[green tomatoes]], sliced 1/4-inch thick
- 1/4 cup [[coconut flour]]
- 2 large [[eggs]], beaten (egg wash)
- 1/2 cup [[pork rinds]], crushed into dust
- 1/2 cup [[parmesan cheese]], finely grated
- 1 tsp [[smoked paprika]]
- 1/2 tsp [[garlic powder]]
- 1/2 tsp [[onion powder]]
- 1/2 tsp [[kosher salt]]
- 1/4 tsp [[black pepper]]
- [[avocado oil spray]] (or olive oil spray)
---

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat; lightly spray with oil.  
2. Set up dredging stations: one dish with coconut flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with pork rind dust, parmesan, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  
3. Coat tomato slices: dredge in coconut flour (shake off excess), dip in egg wash, then press into pork rind–parmesan mix.  
4. Arrange coated slices on parchment. Lightly spray tops with oil.  
5. Bake 15 minutes, flip gently with a spatula, then bake another 10–12 minutes until golden and crisp. Broil 1–2 minutes at the end for extra crunch if needed.  
6. Serve hot with [[Ranch Dressing (Homemade)]] for dipping.  

### Notes
- **Why 400°F, not 425°F?** Parmesan melts first before crisping; slightly lower temp avoids cheese welding to the pan.  
- **Wire rack optional**: If you want extra airflow, place parchment on a rack over the baking sheet. Spray parchment generously before baking.  
- **Chill after breading**: Refrigerating slices 20–30 min before baking helps the coating set.  
- **Air Fryer Option:** Arrange breaded slices in a single layer in the basket. Air fry at 400°F for 10–12 minutes, flipping halfway.  
- **Variation:** Add 1/4 cup almond flour to the breading mix for more structure and less sticking (blend ratio: 1/2 pork rind, 1/4 parmesan, 1/4 almond flour).
