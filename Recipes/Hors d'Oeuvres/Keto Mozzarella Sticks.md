# Directions
1. Cut each mozzarella cheese stick in half and set aside. In a high speed blender or food processor, add your pork rinds, parmesan cheese, and Italian herbs, and blend until a powdery texture remains.

2. Transfer the crumb mixture into a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and water, until combined.

3. Moving quickly, dip each cheese stick in the egg mixture, followed by the dry mixture, and repeat once more. Place the coated mozzarella cheese sticks and place them on a lined plate. Place them in the freezer for two hours.

4. Add 2-3 tablespoons of oil into a non-stick pan and place over medium heat. Once hot, remove the cheese sticks from the freezer and place them in the sizzling oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, before flipping and cooking for a further 3 minutes, or until golden brown.

5. Place the mozzarella sticks onto a plate covered with a paper towel, and serve immediately.
