# Directions
1. **Sauté aromatics**: In a large skillet, heat butter or oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until softened and fragrant (about 3–4 minutes).
2. **Bloom tomato paste**: Push aromatics to the side. Add tomato paste to the center and cook, stirring constantly, until it darkens and smells sweet (about 2 minutes).
3. **Add spices**: Stir in cumin, paprika, and oregano. Toast briefly (30 seconds).
4. **Deglaze**: Add broth or water to loosen the fond and create a flavorful base.
5. **Add cauliflower rice**: Stir in riced cauliflower, mixing thoroughly to coat. Cook until tender and moisture evaporates (about 5–7 minutes).
6. **Finish**: Season with salt. Add lime juice and cilantro if desired.

# Notes
- Serve alongside [[Chicken al Pastor Tacos]] or use as taco bowl base.
