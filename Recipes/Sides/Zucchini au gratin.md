### Ingredients
---
- 2 lb [[zucchini]] (≈ 8 cups), sliced into ¼-inch rounds
- 1 lb [[yellow onion]] (≈ 4 cups), halved and sliced
- 6 tbsp [[unsalted butter]], divided
- 2 tsp [[kosher salt]]
- 1 tsp [[black pepper]]
- 1/4 tsp [[ground nutmeg]]

- 3/4 cup [[gruyère]], grated (≈ 3 oz)
- 3/4 cup [[ground pork rinds]]
---

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Butter an 8×10-inch baking dish.
2. Melt 5 tbsp butter in a large sauté pan over low heat. Add onions; cook ~20 minutes until soft and sweet, not browned.
3. Add zucchini; cover and cook 10 minutes. Uncover; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Cook 5 minutes more to evaporate moisture.
4. Sprinkle in flour; cook 2 minutes, stirring, to remove raw taste.
5. Pour in hot milk; simmer, stirring, until thick, glossy, and coats vegetables.
6. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
7. Toss breadcrumbs with Gruyère; scatter evenly over the top. Dot with remaining 1 tbsp butter.
8. Bake 20 minutes until bubbling and golden. Rest 5 minutes before serving.

# Notes:
- For extra browning, broil 1–2 minutes at the end (watch closely).
- Low-carb swap: use 2 tbsp almond flour for the roux and crushed pork rinds or nut crumbs instead of breadcrumbs.
- Make-ahead: assemble up to 24 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate. Bake uncovered; add 5–10 minutes if cold.
- Freeze: best frozen before baking. Thaw overnight; bake as directed.
- Flavor add-ins: ½ cup finely grated Parmesan mixed with Gruyère; or 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves with the onions.
- Goes great with [[pecan-crusted salmon]] and a bright lemon-dill salad.
