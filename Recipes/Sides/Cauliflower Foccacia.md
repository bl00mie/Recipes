### Ingredients
---
- 2 cups (≈1 medium head) [[cauliflower]], riced and lightly steamed
- 1 ½ cups shredded [[mozzarella cheese]], low-moisture
- ½ cup grated [[parmesan cheese]]
- 2 large [[egg]]
- 1 tsp [[kosher salt]]

- 1 tsp [[fresh rosemary]] or ½ tsp dried (optional, classic focaccia flavor)
---

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a 9×13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.  
2. Steam or microwave riced cauliflower until tender (~5 minutes). Spread on a clean towel, squeeze out as much moisture as possible.  
3. In a mixing bowl, combine cauliflower, mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stir until evenly mixed into a dough-like batter.  
4. Transfer mixture to prepared pan. Press flat and even (about ½-inch thick).  
5. Drizzle top lightly with olive oil and scatter rosemary (if using).  
6. Bake 25–30 minutes until golden brown and set in the center.  
7. Cool 5 minutes, then slice into 8 pieces. Serve warm.  

### Notes
- Net carbs: ~3.1 g per slice.  
- Texture: Chewy in the middle, crisp edges — best eaten warm.  
- Flavor tweaks: Add sun-dried tomatoes, olives, or caramelized onion on top before baking.  
- Storage: Refrigerates 3–4 days; reheat in toaster oven for best texture. Freezes well, wrapped tightly.  
- Uses: Base for open-faced sandwiches, pizza crust, or cut into sticks for dipping.
