### Ingredients
---
- 1 (14 oz) bag [[coleslaw mix]] (green + red cabbage with carrot)
- 1/2 cup [[mayonnaise]]
- 2 tbsp [[apple cider vinegar]]
- 1 tbsp [[erythritol]] or [[monk fruit sweetener]] (to taste)
- 1 tsp [[Dijon mustard]]

### Directions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, sweetener, mustard, celery seed, salt, pepper, and cream if using.
2. Add coleslaw mix and toss to coat evenly.
3. Let rest 10–15 minutes before serving to soften cabbage slightly and let flavors meld.
4. Chill until ready to serve.

### Notes
- Adjust vinegar for tang: add up to 1 tbsp more for brighter flavor.
- Add crunch: fold in chopped [[green onion]], [[celery]], or toasted [[sunflower seeds]].
- Storage: Keeps 2–3 days in the fridge; stir before serving.
- Variation: Replace some mayo with [[Greek yogurt]] for a lighter, tangier version.
