### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Butter an 8×10-inch baking dish.
2. Melt 5 tbsp butter in a large sauté pan over low heat. Add onions; cook ~20 minutes until soft and sweet, not browned.
3. Add zucchini; cover and cook 10 minutes. Uncover; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Cook 5 minutes more to evaporate moisture.
4. Sprinkle in almond flour; cook 2 minutes, stirring, to toast slightly.
5. Pour in cream + water; simmer until warm and slightly thickened.
6. Stir in arrowroot slurry; cook 1–2 minutes until sauce becomes glossy and coats vegetables.
7. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
8. Toss crushed pork rinds with Gruyère; scatter evenly over the top. Dot with remaining 1 tbsp butter.
9. Bake 20 minutes until bubbling and golden. Rest 5 minutes before serving.

### Notes
- Texture: Slightly looser than classic roux, but rich and cohesive.
- Arrowroot tip: Always add as a slurry to hot liquid—never dry.
- Pork rind crust: Adds crunch and salt; skip added salt if using seasoned rinds.
- Make-ahead: Assemble up to 24 hours ahead; refrigerate and bake uncovered.
- Freeze: Best frozen before baking. Thaw overnight; bake as directed.
- Flavor add-ins: ½ cup grated Parmesan mixed with Gruyère; or 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves with the onions.
- Goes great with [[pecan-crusted salmon]] or [[lemon-dill zucchini ribbons]].
