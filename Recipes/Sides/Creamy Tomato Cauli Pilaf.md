### Directions
1. **Sauté aromatics:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook 5–6 minutes until softened and golden. Add garlic and ginger; cook 1 minute more.
2. **Bloom spices:** Stir in cumin, garam masala, turmeric, and paprika. Cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Tomato base:** Add tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 1 minute to deepen flavor.
4. **Simmer:** Pour in stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. **Add cauliflower:** Stir in cauliflower rice, coating it well. Simmer gently 5–7 minutes until the rice absorbs most of the liquid and softens.
6. **Finish with cream:** Stir in heavy cream and cook 2–3 minutes more until creamy and slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning.
7. **Garnish:** Sprinkle with fresh cilantro before serving.

### Notes
- For extra richness, stir in a knob of butter at the end.
- You can make this up to 2 days ahead; reheat gently with a splash of stock or cream.
- Add toasted cashews or sliced almonds for texture if desired.
- Excellent base for [[tandoori chicken drumsticks]] or kebabs.
