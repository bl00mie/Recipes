### Ingredients
---
- 1 large head [[cauliflower]], cut into florets (about 6 cups)
- 2 tablespoons [[butter]]
- 1/4 cup [[heavy cream]] (or [[sour cream]] for tang)
- 2 cloves [[garlic]], roasted or sautéed (optional, for flavor)
- Salt and [[black pepper]], to taste
- 2 tablespoons [[parmesan cheese]] (optional, adds richness)
---
### Directions
1. Steam or boil cauliflower florets until very tender, 8–10 minutes.
2. Drain well and pat dry with a clean towel to remove excess water.
3. Place in food processor (or use an immersion blender). Add butter, cream, garlic (if using), and parmesan.
4. Blend until smooth and creamy. Adjust consistency with a splash more cream if needed.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.

### Notes
- Drain cauliflower thoroughly — excess water makes mash runny.
- Roast garlic ahead for a sweet, mellow flavor.
- Top with a drizzle of olive oil, extra parmesan, or fresh herbs.
- Pairs perfectly with [[pork]], [[beef stew]], or roasted [[chicken]].
