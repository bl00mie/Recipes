### Ingredients
---
- 1 ½ cups (6 oz) shredded [[mozzarella cheese]], low-moisture part-skim
- 2 oz [[cream cheese]], cubed
- 1 ¼ cups [[almond flour]]

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine mozzarella and cream cheese. Microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring, until melted and smooth (~1½ minutes total).  
3. Stir in almond flour, egg, salt, garlic powder, and baking powder (if using). Mix until a cohesive dough forms.  
4. Place dough between two sheets of parchment and roll into a ¼-inch-thick rectangle or circle. Remove top parchment.  
5. Transfer dough (on bottom parchment) to baking sheet. Lightly brush or spray with olive oil.  
6. Bake 8–10 minutes until puffed and golden at the edges.  
7. Flip carefully, bake another 3–5 minutes until evenly cooked.  
8. Cool slightly before slicing or topping.  

### Notes
- Net carbs: ~4.4 g per serving.  
- Flavor tweaks: Add 1 tsp dried Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, or sesame seeds to dough before baking.  
- Serving ideas: Use as a base for low-carb pizza, cut into wedges for dipping, or top with fresh tomato + basil for a caprese-style flatbread.  
- Storage: Keeps 3–4 days refrigerated; re-crisp in a skillet or toaster oven. Can be frozen up to 2 months.
