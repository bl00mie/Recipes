### Ingredients
---
- 4 [[pork chops]], about 1 inch thick (bone-in preferred, but boneless also works)
- 2 tablespoons [[olive oil]]
- 8 ounces [[mushrooms]], sliced (cremini or button)
- 1 [[shallot]] or 1/4 [[onion]], finely minced
- 2 cloves [[garlic]], minced
- 1/2 cup [[chicken broth]] or [[white wine]]
- 1/2 cup [[heavy cream]] (or half-and-half)
- 1 teaspoon [[dijon mustard]] (optional)
- 1 teaspoon [[thyme]] (fresh, or 1/2 teaspoon dried)
- Salt and [[black pepper]], to taste
- 1 tablespoon [[butter]]

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Pat pork chops dry and season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Heat sauté pan over medium-high. Add olive oil, then sear chops 3–4 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove to a plate.
4. Pour off excess fat if needed, leaving about 1 tablespoon. Add mushrooms and sauté until they release liquid and begin to brown, 6–8 minutes.
5. Add shallot and garlic. Cook 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
6. Deglaze with broth or wine, scraping up browned bits. Reduce by half.
7. Stir in cream, dijon, and thyme. Simmer 3–4 minutes until slightly thickened.
8. Return chops and juices to pan. Spoon sauce over them. Transfer pan to oven and cook 6–10 minutes, until internal temp reaches 140°F.
9. Remove from oven. Rest 5 minutes (they’ll finish around 145°F).
10. Serve with mushroom sauce over the top.

### Notes
- Bone-in chops are juicier and harder to overcook, but boneless works if that’s what you have.
- Add spinach to the sauce near the end for extra greens.
- Serve with [[cauliflower mash]], roasted asparagus, or salad.
- If using thin chops, cook entirely on stovetop and make sauce separately.
