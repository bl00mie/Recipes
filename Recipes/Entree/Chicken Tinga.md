# Ingredients
---
- 1 tbsp [[olive oil]]
- 1 small [[yellow onion]] thinly sliced

- 1 tsp [[cumin]]
- 1 tsp [[Mexican oregano]]
- 2–3 whole [[chipotle peppers in adobo]] chopped

# Directions
1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft and golden.
2. Add garlic, cumin, and oregano. Stir until fragrant.
3. Stir in chipotle peppers and a spoonful of adobo sauce.
4. Add stewed tomato sauce and simmer for 5–10 minutes.
5. Fold in shredded chicken and broth if needed. Simmer until heated through and saucy.
6. Taste and adjust salt or heat as needed.

# Notes
- Use fewer chipotles for a milder version, or add more adobo for extra smokiness.
- Great for tacos, tostadas, rice bowls, or as a freezer-friendly enchilada filling.
- Try topping with [[cotija cheese]] and [[lime crema]] for extra punch.
