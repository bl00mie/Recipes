### Ingredients
---
- 8 [[chicken tenders]] (fresh or thawed from frozen)
- 1/4 cup [[coconut flour]]
- 2 large [[eggs]], beaten
- 1 cup [[pork rinds]], crushed into dust
- 1/2 cup [[parmesan cheese]], finely grated
- 1/2 tsp [[smoked paprika]]
- 1/2 tsp [[garlic powder]]
- 1/2 tsp [[onion powder]]
- 1/2 tsp [[kosher salt]]
- 1/4 tsp [[black pepper]]
- [[avocado oil spray]] (or olive oil spray)
---

### Directions
1. Optional brine: soak tenders in lightly salted water (or 1/2 cup cream + 1 tsp vinegar + 1/2 cup water) for 30–60 minutes. Drain and pat dry.  
2. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment and spray lightly with oil.  
3. Set up dredging stations: one dish with coconut flour, one with beaten eggs, one with pork rind dust, parmesan, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  
4. Dredge tenders: coat lightly in coconut flour, dip in egg, then press into the breading mix until well coated.  
5. Arrange on parchment. Lightly spray tops with oil.  
6. Bake 12–15 minutes, flipping halfway, until coating is golden brown and chicken reaches 165°F internal.  
7. Rest 5 minutes before serving.  

### Notes
- **Brine = juicier tenders**. Even 30 minutes makes a difference.  
- **Air fryer option:** Cook at 400°F for 10–12 minutes, flipping halfway.  
- **Variation:** Replace parmesan with sharp cheddar for extra flavor (but it may melt more, so lower oven to 400°F).  
- **Serving ideas:** Pair with [[Ranch Dressing (Homemade)]] or [[Mustard Dipping Sauce (Low-Carb)]]; serve with roasted broccoli, zucchini fries, or a simple salad.
