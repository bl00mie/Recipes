# Directions
1. In a small bowl whisk together chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, lime juice and olive oil until a sauce forms.

2. Brush each side of the fish strips with the sauce.

3. In a large pan over medium high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and place a sheet of parchment paper on the pan. Swirl the parchment paper around to ensure it is coated in oil  before flipping the parchment sheet over. Arrange the fish on top of the parchment paper, and allow to cook for about 3 minutes per side.

4. In a large bowl combine mango, red pepper, red onion, jalapeno, cilantro. Drizzle with lime juice and olive oil and season to taste with salt and black pepper.

5. In a high powered blender or food processor add avocado, lime juice, greek yogurt, mayonnaise, garlic powder, salt and water. Blend until smooth.

6. Warm your corn tortillas. To each tortilla add a scoop of mango salsa, one piece of fish and a drizzle of avocado lime crema. Garnish with additional cilantro and a drizzle of lime juice if desired.
