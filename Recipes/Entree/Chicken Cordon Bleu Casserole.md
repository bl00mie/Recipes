# Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).

2. In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with oil. Season with sea salt and black pepper.

3. Arrange the cauliflower on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until golden on the edges.

4. Meanwhile, in a large bowl,&nbsp;stir together the sour cream, heavy cream, mustard, garlic, and half of the shredded cheese (1 cup).&nbsp;Stir in the chicken and ham.

5. When the cauliflower is done, take it out of the oven and leave the oven on at 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Stir the cauliflower into the bowl. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, if needed.

6. Transfer the casserole mixture into a 9x13 in (23x33 cm) casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of cheese over the top, followed by the pork rinds, if using.

7. Bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted. If desired, you can broil the casserole for 2 to 3 minutes to brown the topping.
