# Directions
1. Cut the cod into strips, 1 inch wide by 3 inches long. Pat dry with paper towels.

2. Set up three shallow medium bowls: coconut flour in the first, whisk eggs in the second, and in the third, stir together pork rinds, lemon pepper seasoning, and paprika.

3. Using different hands for the wet and dry ingredients, dredge a cod strip in the coconut flour, then dip into the egg, and finally in the pork rind mixture. Place onto a cutting board and repeat with all the cod pieces.

4. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the fish sticks in a single layer and fry for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden and cooked through.
