### Ingredients
---
**Roasted cauliflower “croutons”**
- 6 cups (about 720 g) [[cauliflower florets]] (from frozen is fine)
- 2 tbsp [[olive oil]]
- 1 tsp [[kosher salt]]
- 1/2 tsp [[black pepper]]
- 1 tsp [[garlic powder]]
- 1 tsp [[smoked paprika]] *(optional but awesome)*

**Bake**
- 5–6 cups (about 520 g) [[broccoli florets]] (from frozen is fine)
- 3 cups (about 480 g) [[black soy beans]] (cooked)
- 6 tbsp (85 g) [[butter]]
- 1 small [[onion]] (finely diced) *(or 1 1/2 tsp [[onion powder]])*
- 4 cloves [[garlic]] (minced)
- 2 tbsp [[cream cheese]] *(optional but strongly recommended for “velvet” sauce)*
- 2 cups (480 g) [[heavy cream]]
- 2 cups (200 g) [[cheddar cheese]] (shredded, plus more to top)
- 1/2 cup (50 g) [[parmesan cheese]] (finely grated)
- 1 tsp [[Dijon mustard]] *(optional but adds “grown-up” depth)*
- 1 tsp [[kosher salt]] (start with 1/2 tsp, then adjust)
- 1/2 tsp [[black pepper]]
- 1/2 tsp [[red pepper flakes]] *(optional)*
- 1/4 tsp [[nutmeg]] *(optional “secret weapon” in cream sauces)*

**Optional “make it unfair” add-ins**
- 8 slices [[bacon]] (cooked, chopped)
- 1 cup (100 g) [[mushrooms]] (sliced, sautéed)
- 1 tbsp [[hot sauce]]
- 2 tbsp [[chives]] (sliced)

### Directions
1. **Heat the oven.** Set to 425°F.
2. **Roast the cauliflower hard (flavor + texture).** Toss [[cauliflower florets]] with [[olive oil]], salt, pepper, [[garlic powder]], and [[smoked paprika]]. Spread on a sheet pan in a single layer. Roast **25–35 minutes**, flipping once, until deeply browned on edges. This is your “crouton” layer—don’t rush it.
3. **Cook the broccoli just enough.** While cauliflower roasts, steam or microwave [[broccoli florets]] until hot and bright but still firm (frozen broccoli: usually 4–6 minutes). Drain very well. (Water is the enemy of creamy bakes.)
4. **Make the sauce base.** In a large pot over medium heat, melt [[butter]]. Add diced [[onion]] and cook 5–7 minutes until soft. Add [[garlic]] and cook 30 seconds.
5. **Make it velvet.** Stir in [[cream cheese]] (if using) until smooth. Pour in [[heavy cream]] and bring to a gentle simmer (no hard boil).
6. **Melt cheeses + season.** Add [[cheddar cheese]] and [[parmesan cheese]] gradually, stirring until melted and glossy. Stir in [[Dijon mustard]], salt (start with 1/2 tsp), pepper, [[red pepper flakes]] (if using), and [[nutmeg]] (if using). Taste and adjust salt.
7. **Add beans + broccoli.** Stir in [[black soy beans]] and broccoli until coated.
8. **Assemble.** Move mixture to a 9x13 baking dish. Top with the roasted cauliflower “croutons.” Add an extra handful of cheddar on top if you want maximum crust.
9. **Bake.** Bake at 425°F for **12–18 minutes** until bubbling at edges and lightly browned on top.
10. **Rest + serve.** Let rest 10 minutes (it thickens). Serve hot.

### Notes
- **Why the cauliflower is separate:** Roasting it first keeps it crisp-ish and intensely flavored. If you mix it into the cream bake raw/frozen, it weeps water and gets bland.
- **Bean amount:** This uses **3 cups** beans; if you want it beanier, go up to **4 cups** and add a splash more cream.
- **Extra umami (worth it):** Add 1 tsp [[Worcestershire sauce]] (check label) or 1/2 tsp soy sauce to the cream while simmering.
- **If it’s too thick:** Stir in a splash of cream or broth before baking.
- **If it’s too thin:** Simmer the sauce 2–3 minutes longer before adding cheese, and make sure broccoli is well-drained.
- **Meal prep:** Keeps 4–5 days refrigerated. Reheat in oven/air fryer for best texture.
