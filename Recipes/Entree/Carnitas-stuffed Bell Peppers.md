---

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Lightly oil a baking dish.
2. Slice peppers in half lengthwise and remove seeds/membranes. Rub with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. Roast peppers cut-side up for 12 minutes to soften slightly.
4. In a bowl, combine carnitas with salsa verde.
5. Fill each pepper half with the carnitas mixture. Top with Monterey Jack.
6. Return to oven and bake 12–15 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbling.
7. Sprinkle with cotija, green onions, and cilantro before serving.

### Notes
- Crisp carnitas in a skillet before mixing with salsa for extra texture.  
- Works with poblano peppers for a smokier flavor.  
- Make-ahead: Roast and fill peppers, refrigerate, then bake with cheese just before serving.  
- Freezer-friendly: Stuff peppers but don’t bake; wrap and freeze. Bake from frozen, adding 10 minutes.
