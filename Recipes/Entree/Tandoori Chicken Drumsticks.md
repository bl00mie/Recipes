### Ingredients
---
- 16 [[chicken drumsticks]] (half skin-on, half skinless), patted dry
- 1 cup [[plain Greek yogurt]] (full-fat)
- 2 tbsp [[lemon juice]]
- 1 1/2 tbsp [[olive oil]] or neutral oil
- 1 tbsp [[garam masala]]
- 2 tsp [[ground cumin]]
- 2 tsp [[ground coriander]]
- 1 1/2 tsp [[turmeric]]
- 1 1/2 tsp [[smoked paprika]] (or Kashmiri chili powder for authentic color)
- 1 tsp [[ground ginger]]
- 1 tbsp [[garlic]], minced
- 1 tbsp [[fresh ginger]], grated
- 1 1/2 tsp [[kosher salt]]
- 1/2 tsp [[black pepper]]
- Optional: 1/4 tsp [[liquid smoke]] for a subtle grill aroma

### Directions
1. **Prepare the marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, oil, all spices, garlic, and ginger until smooth.
2. **Marinate the chicken:** Add drumsticks to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly. Massage marinade under the skin of the skin-on pieces if possible. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.
3. **Preheat oven:** Heat to 425°F (220°C). Line a sheet pan with foil and place a wire rack on top. Oil the rack lightly.
4. **Roast:** Arrange drumsticks on the rack, shaking off excess marinade. Roast for 35–45 minutes, flipping halfway, until lightly charred and internal temp hits 185°F. 
5. **Optional char:** For extra color, finish under the broiler for 2–3 minutes per side.
6. **Rest:** Let the chicken sit for 5 minutes before serving to keep it juicy.

### Notes
- **Grill option:** Preheat to medium-high, oil grates well, and grill 20–25 min, turning often until deeply colored and cooked through.
- **Liquid smoke tip:** Mix into the yogurt marinade if not grilling — gives that classic tandoor aroma.
- **Make-ahead:** Marinated drumsticks can be frozen raw; thaw overnight before roasting.
- Serve with [[Tomato & Cream Cauliflower Pilaf]] and [[mozzarella flatbread]] for a low-carb feast.
