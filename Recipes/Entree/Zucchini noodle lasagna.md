- 1 tbsp chopped [[parsley]] or [[basil]]
- 1 tsp [[kosher salt]]

### Directions
1. **Prep zucchini noodles:** Slice zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch planks. Sprinkle with 1 tsp salt, layer on towels, and rest 20 minutes. Pat dry. Arrange on sheet pans, brush lightly with olive oil, and bake at 400°F (204°C) for 10–12 minutes until softened and water has evaporated. Set aside.
2. **Mix ricotta:** Stir together ricotta, egg, parmesan, cream, nutmeg, parsley, salt, and pepper until smooth and spreadable.
3. **Assemble lasagna:** Lightly oil a 9x13 baking dish. Spread thin layer of meat sauce on bottom. Layer zucchini slices, slightly overlapping. Dollop 1/3 of ricotta mixture in spoonfuls, then spread gently. Add 1/3 of remaining meat sauce, then sprinkle mozzarella. Repeat layers (zucchini → ricotta → sauce → mozzarella) until you’ve used ingredients, finishing with zucchini, sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan on top.
4. **Bake:** Cover dish with foil (tent to avoid cheese sticking). Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 35–40 minutes covered, then uncover and bake 15–20 minutes until bubbling and golden.
5. **Rest:** Let lasagna rest at least 15–20 minutes before slicing. This allows layers to set and prevents excess liquid.

### Notes
- Zucchini prep: Salting + baking removes excess water and prevents soupy lasagna. Don’t skip resting before slicing.
- Ricotta hack: Add cream to loosen, makes spreading easier and layers more even.
- Sauce volume: 5–6 cups of [[Lasagna meat sauce]] works for a 9x13 pan with 3–4 zucchini layers.
- Cheese blend: Add provolone or fontina to mozzarella for extra melt.
- Storage: Keeps 4 days refrigerated; freezes well in portions. Reheat gently, covered.
