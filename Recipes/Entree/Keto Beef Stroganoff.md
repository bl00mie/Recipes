# Directions
1. Slice the beef into 1-inch strips, cutting against the grain.

2. In a non-stick pan or skillet, add the butter and place it over medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic and onions and cook until soft. Remove them from the pan.

3. Add the sirloin and cook for 4-5 minutes, until no longer pink. Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes.

4. Add the mushrooms and the cooked onion and garlic. Stir through the almond flour. Let everything simmer for 5 minutes, before stirring through the sour cream until combined and smooth.

5. Remove the skillet off the heat and serve immediately with your favorite low carb pasta or mock potatoes.
