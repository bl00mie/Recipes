# Directions
1. Spread a thin layer of oil on one side of the tortilla and gently slice a cut through the wrap from the bottom to the middle (to create a flap).

2. Place the tortilla on a non-stick pan over medium heat.

3. Arrange the toppings in each quarter of the tortilla, sprinkle the salt and pepper over the avocado. Once the cheese has melted, gently fold over the edges in three folds: starting at the bottom then moving to the side then finally finishing with a fold towards the bottom. Slice in half and serve with remaining apples.
