### Ingredients

**For the base:**  
- 1 medium head [[cauliflower]] (about 4 cups riced)  
- 2 large [[egg]]s  
- 1 cup shredded [[mozzarella cheese]]  
- 1/4 cup grated [[parmesan cheese]]  
- 1 tsp [[dried oregano]]  
- 1/2 tsp [[kosher salt]]  
- 1/4 tsp [[black pepper]]  

**For the topping:**  
- 1/2 cup [[roasted red pepper pesto]] (see card)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
2. Rice cauliflower in a food processor until fine. Microwave in a covered bowl 5 minutes, then cool slightly. Place in a clean towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.  
3. In a large bowl, mix cauliflower, eggs, mozzarella, Parmesan, oregano, salt, and pepper until combined.  
4. Spread mixture into a 10-inch round or rectangle on the baking sheet, about 1/4-inch thick. Bake 20–25 minutes until golden and firm.  
5. Remove base from oven. Spread evenly with roasted red pepper pesto.  
6. Tear prosciutto into pieces and scatter over the top. Return to oven for 5 minutes to warm.  
7. Remove and top immediately with fresh arugula, shaved Parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil.  
8. Slice into 6 pieces and serve hot.  

### Notes
- Net carbs: ~4.5 g per slice.  
- Base tip: The drier the cauliflower, the sturdier the crust. Don’t skip squeezing it out.  
- Variations: Swap prosciutto for grilled chicken or roasted eggplant for vegetarian.  
- Serving idea: Pair with [[garden tomato soup]] or a crisp green salad.
