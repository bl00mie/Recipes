# Directions
1. Season the chicken with sea salt and black pepper.

2. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs. In a medium bowl, place the crushed pork rinds.

3. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.

4. Dip the chicken pieces in the egg, shake off the excess, then coat with the pork rind crumbs on all sides. (Alternatively, you can place all the chicken pieces in the egg at once, and take them out one by one to dip in the crumbs.) Working in batches, place a single layer of chicken into the pan. Cook for a few minutes on each side, until golden and cooked through.

5. Remove the chicken from the pan and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Keep the skillet for the sauce.

6. While the chicken rests, in the same skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for about 1 minute, until fragrant.

7. Add the coconut aminos, wine vinegar, orange zest, powdered monk fruit allulose blend, and ground ginger. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom and deglaze the pan.

8. Bring the sauce to a gentle boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, until the volume is reduced, and the sauce thickens and looks glossy.

9. Return the chicken to the pan and toss to coat. The sauce will thicken as it cools from hot to warm.
