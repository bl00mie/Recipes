# Directions
1. Remove the cauliflower leaves and stems. Push the cauliflower florets into a running food processor, with a grating attachment to make cauliflower rice. Alternatively, rice the cauliflower using a box grater.

2. In a large saute pan over medium heat, heat one tablespoon of butter. Once hot add the chicken pieces and season with salt and pepper. Saute until cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and set aside.

3. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the remaining butter. Add the onion, garlic, and carrots. Saute for 4-5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the carrots have softened up a bit. Add the peas and saute for one more minute.

4. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and push the veggies to the edge of the pan. Add the eggs in the center and cook until barely scrambled.

5. Add the cauliflower and chicken, and saute for  5 more minutes, until the cauliflower is soft but not mushy.

6. Remove from the heat and add in the coconut aminos, sesame oil, and chopped green onions. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.
