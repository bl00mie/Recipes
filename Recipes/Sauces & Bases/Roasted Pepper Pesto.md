### Ingredients
---
- 2 large [[red bell pepper]] (roasted, peeled, and seeded)
- 1/2 cup [[almonds]] (or [[pine nuts]] for classic pesto), lightly toasted
- 1/2 cup grated [[parmesan cheese]]
- 2 cloves [[garlic]], peeled
- 1/4 cup [[fresh basil]] leaves
- 1/4 cup [[fresh parsley]] leaves (optional, for brightness)
- 1/2 tsp [[kosher salt]] (to taste)

---

### Directions
1. Roast peppers over an open flame, under the broiler, or in a 450°F (232°C) oven until skin is charred. Place in a covered bowl to steam 10 minutes, then peel, seed, and roughly chop.  
2. In a food processor, combine roasted peppers, almonds, Parmesan, garlic, basil, parsley, salt, and pepper. Pulse until finely chopped.  
3. With the motor running, drizzle in olive oil until smooth and spreadable.  
4. Taste and adjust with lemon juice or vinegar for brightness.  
5. Store in an airtight container, covered with a thin layer of olive oil, up to 1 week in the fridge.  

### Notes
- Net carbs: ~2.8 g per serving.  
- Variations: Use walnuts for earthier flavor; swap parsley for more basil if you prefer classic pesto notes.  
- Serving ideas: Spread on [[cauliflower focaccia]] as a pizza base, toss with roasted vegetables, or swirl into [[garden tomato soup]] for smoky sweetness.  
- Flavor bomb pairing: Top red pepper pesto flatbread with prosciutto, fresh arugula, and shaved Parmesan.
