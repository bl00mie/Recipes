### Directions
1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook 8-10 minutes, stirring often, until softened and lightly golden at the edges.  
2. Add garlic and cook 1 minute until fragrant.  
3. Push soffritto aside, add ground turkey. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned, breaking into small pieces.  
4. Stir in tomato paste, cook 2-3 minutes to caramelize.  
5. Deglaze with red wine (or stock), scraping up browned bits. Let simmer until liquid mostly reduces.  
6. Stir in tomato sauce, Worcestershire, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. If you have a parmesan rind, drop it in now.  
7. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cover partially and cook 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water or stock if too thick.  
8. Finish with cream or milk (if using) and 1/4 cup parmesan. Stir until smooth. Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, or Worcestershire if needed.  
9. Serve over zoodles, spaghetti squash, or low-carb pasta. Garnish with fresh basil and extra parmesan.

### Notes
- For extra umami: add a splash more Worcestershire or a spoon of anchovy paste.  
- If your tomato sauce is very acidic, stir in 1/2 tsp sweetener (erythritol or monk fruit).  
- Sauce keeps 4-5 days in fridge, or freezes well up to 3 months.  
- Excellent over roasted zucchini, spaghetti squash, or even as a stuffed pepper filling.
