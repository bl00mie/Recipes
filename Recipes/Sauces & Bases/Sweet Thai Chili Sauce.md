# Ingredients
---
- 1/4 cp [[rice vinegar]]
- 1/4 cp [[water]]
- 2 tbsp [[Monk Fruit Allulose Blend]]
- 1 [[Garlic]] clove minced
- 1/4 tsp grated ginger
- 1/2 tsp [[crushed red pepper]]
- 1 tsp [[sambal oelek]]
- ~~1 tsp [[Coconut aminos]]~~
- 1/2 tsp orange zest
- 1 tsp orange juice
- 1/4 tsp [[Arrowroot Powder]]
---

# Directions
1. Combine all except arrowroot in a saucepan
2. Reduce until slightly syrupy
3. Mix arrowroot powder in cold water, then whisk into the sauce
4. Let cool to thicken further

### Notes
- this was way too salty in my first attempt. I would cut out the coconut aminos
- Go very light on the arrowroot. I ended up with dense jelly and had to re-heat and re-hydrate to get it spooned out.
