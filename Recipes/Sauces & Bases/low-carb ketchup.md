### Ingredients
---
- 1 can (6 oz) [[tomato paste]]
- 1/2 cup [[water]], plus more as needed
- 1/4 cup [[apple cider vinegar]]
- 2 tbsp [[allulose]] (or 1 tbsp erythritol + 1 tsp monk fruit)
- 1 tsp [[smoked paprika]]
- 1/2 tsp [[garlic powder]]
- 1/2 tsp [[onion powder]]
- 1/4 tsp [[mustard powder]]
- 1/4 tsp [[salt]]
- 1/8 tsp [[ground clove]] or [[allspice]] (optional, for depth)
- 1/8 tsp [[cinnamon]] (optional, adds Heinz-like warmth)

---

### Directions
1. Whisk [[tomato paste]], 1/2 cup [[water]], and [[apple cider vinegar]] in a small saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add remaining ingredients and stir until smooth.
3. Simmer gently (do not boil) for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.
4. Adjust sweetness, salt, or acidity to taste.
5. Cool completely, then transfer to a sealed jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

### Notes
- For a “Heinz clone,” include the cinnamon and clove. For a more savory ketchup, omit them.  
- Add a drop of [[liquid smoke]] for instant BBQ depth.  
- If texture is too thin, simmer longer uncovered; too thick, add a splash of [[water]] or [[vinegar]].  
- Blend in a roasted red pepper for a smoky, fire-roasted version.  
- Excellent as a base for [[BBQ sauce]], [[cocktail sauce]], or a glaze for [[meatloaf]].
