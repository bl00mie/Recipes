### Directions
1. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown beef and sausage in 1 tbsp olive oil, breaking up into crumbles. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Drain excess fat if needed.  
2. Add onion, carrot, and celery to the same pot with remaining olive oil if necessary. Cook 8–10 minutes until softened and golden.  
3. Stir in garlic; cook 1 minute until fragrant. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 2 minutes until darkened and caramelized.  
4. Deglaze pan with red wine, scraping up browned bits. Reduce by half, about 3 minutes.  
5. Add stewed garden tomatoes, cooked meat, bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.  
6. Simmer uncovered 45–60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened and rich. Add small splashes of stock if too dry.  
7. Remove bay leaf. Stir in butter and/or cream if desired. Taste and adjust seasoning.  
8. Use immediately in lasagna, or cool and store up to 4 days in the fridge, 3 months in the freezer.  

### Notes
- Garden tomato tip: If tomatoes are sweet (Lemon Boys, cherries), balance with 1–2 tsp red wine vinegar.  
- Meat variation: Use beef + veal + pork for a traditional ragù, or swap in turkey for leaner sauce.  
- Texture control: Longer simmer = deeper flavor and thicker consistency.  
- Flavor boost: A pinch of red pepper flakes adds subtle heat.  
- Serving ideas: Perfect for [[Zucchini noodle lasagna]], [[cauliflower focaccia pizza]], or spooned over roasted vegetables.
