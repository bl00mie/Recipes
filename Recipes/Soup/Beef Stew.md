### Directions
1. Pat beef dry and season with salt and pepper.  
2. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven. Sear beef in batches until browned, then remove.  
3. Add onion and garlic, sauté 3–4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste.  
4. Deglaze with wine (or broth), scraping browned bits.  
5. Return beef, add broth, herbs, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring to simmer.  
6. Cover and cook gently (stovetop low or 325°F oven) for 1 1/2 hours.  
7. Add rutabaga, radishes, and carrots. Continue cooking 45–60 minutes until beef and veg are tender.  
8. If thicker stew is desired, stir in xanthan gum or arrowroot slurry and simmer briefly.  
9. Season to taste and serve hot.  

### Notes
- Radishes lose sharpness and turn mild, potato-like when stewed.  
- Don’t overload carrots if managing carbs — 1–2 adds color and sweetness without spiking carbs.  
- Freezes well in portions.  
- Garnish with fresh parsley for brightness.
