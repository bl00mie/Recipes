### Ingredients
---
- 1 1/2 lb [[chicken breast]], halved
- 6 cups [[chicken stock]] (homemade preferred)
- 2 tbsp [[butter]]
- 1 medium [[onion]], diced
- 3 cloves [[garlic]], minced
- 2 cans (4 oz each) [[diced green chiles]] (mild or hot)
- 1 tsp [[ground cumin]]
- 1/2 tsp [[smoked paprika]]
- 1/2 tsp [[dried oregano]]
- 1/4 tsp [[cayenne pepper]] (optional)
- 1/3 cup [[heavy cream]]
- 4 oz [[cream cheese]], softened and cubed

---

### Directions
1. In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute.
2. Add diced green chiles, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, and cayenne; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Pour in chicken stock and add chicken breasts. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Remove chicken and shred; return to pot.
5. Stir in heavy cream and cream cheese, whisking until smooth. Add shredded cheese and stir until melted and silky.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and top with cilantro and a lime wedge.

### Notes
- If you have dried ancho/guajillo/pasilla chiles from your adobo, toast briefly, soak, blend into a paste, and add with step 2 for deep, smoky complexity. Start with one rehydrated pepper and add more to taste.
- To thicken: blend 1 cup of soup and return it to the pot.
- Great with [[cauliflower focaccia]] or avocado slices on top.
- Keeps 4 days refrigerated.
