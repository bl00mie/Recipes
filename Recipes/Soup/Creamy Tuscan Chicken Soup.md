### Ingredients
---
- 1 1/2 lb [[chicken breast]], cut in halves
- 6 cups [[chicken stock]]
- 2 tbsp [[olive oil]]
- 1 medium [[onion]], diced
- 3 cloves [[garlic]], minced
- 1/2 cup chopped [[sun-dried tomatoes]], packed in oil (drained)
- 1 tsp [[dried Italian herb blend]] (or 1/2 tsp oregano + 1/2 tsp thyme)
- 1/2 tsp [[red pepper flakes]] (optional)
- 1/3 cup [[heavy cream]]

---

### Directions
1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute more.
2. Add sun-dried tomatoes, Italian herbs, and red pepper flakes; stir until fragrant.
3. Pour in chicken stock and add chicken breasts. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Remove chicken and shred with two forks. Return shredded chicken to the pot.
5. Stir in heavy cream, cream cheese, and parmesan, whisking until smooth and creamy.
6. Add spinach and simmer gently until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper. Serve hot.

### Notes
- A squeeze of lemon at the end brightens the soup.
- Swap kale for spinach for a heartier bite.
- Pairs well with [[cauliflower focaccia]] or a green salad.
- Keeps 4 days refrigerated; flavors deepen overnight.
