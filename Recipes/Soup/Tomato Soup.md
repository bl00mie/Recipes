### Ingredients
---
- 2.5 lb [[moskovich tomato]] (roughly chopped)
- 0.5 lb [[lemon boy tomato]] (roughly chopped)
- 1 medium [[yellow onion]], quartered
- 4 cloves [[garlic]], unpeeled
- 2 tbsp [[olive oil]]
- 1 tbsp [[unsalted butter]]
- 2 cups [[chicken stock]] or [[vegetable stock]] (adjust for thickness)
- 3 sprigs [[fresh thyme]] or 6–8 leaves [[basil]]
- 1 tsp [[kosher salt]] (to taste)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).  
2. Spread half the Moskovich, onion, garlic, and optional red bell pepper on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast 30–40 minutes until caramelized.  
3. In a large pot, combine roasted vegetables with the remaining Moskovich and Lemon Boy tomatoes. Add stock and thyme/basil. Simmer uncovered ~20 minutes.  
4. Remove thyme stems. Squeeze roasted garlic from skins into the pot. Blend until smooth using an immersion blender (or transfer to a blender in batches).  
5. For extra silkiness, strain soup through a fine-mesh sieve. Return to pot.  
6. Stir in butter and cream. Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, and optional monkfruit/erythritol if more sweetness is desired.  
7. Serve hot with low-carb garnishes.  

### Notes
- Net carbs: ~10 g per serving.  
- Garnishes: Drizzle of basil oil, grated Parmesan, or toasted pumpkin seeds.  
- For more richness: Add 2 oz [[cream cheese]] while blending.  
- Meal pairing: Great with [[cauliflower focaccia]] or [[almond flour crackers]].  
- Make-ahead: Soup keeps 4–5 days refrigerated; freeze up to 3 months.  
- Flavor tweak: Smoked paprika or a pinch of chili flakes adds warmth.
