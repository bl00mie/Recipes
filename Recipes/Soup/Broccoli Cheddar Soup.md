### Ingredients
---
- 2 tbsp [[unsalted butter]]
- 1 medium [[yellow onion]], diced
- 2 cloves [[garlic]], minced
- 4 cups [[chicken stock]] (or vegetable stock)
- 1 lb [[Broccoli Cheddar Soup]], cut into florets and stems (≈ 6 cups)
- 1 cup [[heavy cream]]

### Directions
1. In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute.
2. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in broccoli; cover and cook 6–8 minutes, until just fork-tender and bright green.
3. Remove from heat. Blend soup (immersion blender or batches in a countertop blender) until completely smooth.
4. Return pot to low heat. Stir in heavy cream and mascarpone; whisk until smooth and silky.
5. Turn off the heat (soup should be hot but not bubbling). Add grated cheddar a handful at a time, stirring gently until fully melted and incorporated.
6. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with optional garnishes.

### Notes
- **Key tip**: Add cheddar *off heat* to prevent graininess. Soup should be ~160–170°F, not boiling.  
- Mascarpone (or cream cheese) helps emulsify the cheddar and prevents clumping.  
- For extra richness, swap half the cheddar for Colby Jack or Monterey Jack.  
- Don’t overcook broccoli — bright green = flavorful. Mushy broccoli = sulfurous and bitter.  
- Freezer-friendly: cool fully, freeze in 2-cup portions, reheat gently over low heat.
