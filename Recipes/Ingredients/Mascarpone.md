### Ingredients
---
- 2 cups [[heavy cream]] (not ultra-pasteurized if possible)
- 1 tbsp [[lemon juice]] (or distilled white vinegar)
---

### Directions
1. In a small saucepan, heat cream over medium-low heat until it reaches 185°F (use a thermometer).
2. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat to low and cook 5 minutes, stirring gently, until cream thickens slightly.
3. Remove from heat and let cool 20 minutes.
4. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour cream mixture into the strainer.
5. Refrigerate and drain for 8–12 hours. The liquid (whey) will drip out, leaving thick mascarpone in the cloth.
6. Transfer mascarpone to an airtight container and refrigerate. Use within 5–7 days.

### Notes
- The longer you let it drain, the thicker the mascarpone.  
- Don’t skip the thermometer — overheating cream can ruin the texture.  
- Use lemon juice for a faint citrus brightness, vinegar for a completely neutral flavor.  
- Mascarpone can be used in [[broccoli cheddar soup]], desserts like tiramisu, or spread on low-carb bread.  
- For extra creaminess, fold in a pinch of salt once drained.
