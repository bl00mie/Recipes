### Base Formula
---
- 4 cups [[water]]
- 1/4 cup [[kosher salt]] (or 3 tablespoons table salt)
- 2 tablespoons [[sugar]] or [[erythritol]] (optional, balances flavor)
- Aromatics: 2 cloves [[garlic]], 1 [[bay leaf]], 1 teaspoon [[peppercorns]], optional herbs
---

### Directions
1. Heat 1 cup of the water with salt (and sugar if using) until dissolved.  
2. Add remaining cold water and aromatics. Cool completely.  
3. Submerge meat fully in brine, cover, and refrigerate.  
   - Thin pork chops or chicken breasts: 30 minutes to 2 hours  
   - Thick pork chops: 4–6 hours  
   - Whole chicken: 8–12 hours  
4. Rinse meat briefly, pat dry, and cook as desired.  

### Notes
- Don’t over-brine: too long makes meat mushy or overly salty.  
- Add spices, citrus peels, or herbs for variation.  
- For quick weeknight brine, even 20–30 minutes helps with juiciness.
