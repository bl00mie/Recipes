# A1 – First Teardown: Basic Manual Movement

## 🎯 Objective
Perform a complete disassembly and reassembly (no cleaning yet) of a simple mid-century manual-wind movement.  
Learn the names, order, and handling of each part without damaging or losing components.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Materials
- Small screwdriver set  
- Brass and steel tweezers  
- Movement holder (standard wristwatch size)  
- Loupe or headband magnifier (5×–10×)  
- Parts tray or ice-cube tray  
- Rodico & pegwood  
- Hand levers and dial protector  
- Finger cots or gloves  
- Notebook for screw order notes

## 🧩 Steps

### 1. Pre-check
- Wind 2–3 clicks and confirm the balance swings.  
- Record **timegrapher** baseline: rate, amplitude, beat error.  
- Photograph both sides for reassembly reference.

### 2. Remove the movement from the case
1. Unscrew or pry off the case back.  
2. Gently pull the crown out to the hand-setting position.  
3. Locate and press the **stem release detent** (small button or screw near the stem entry) while pulling the crown/stem free.  
4. Remove case screws or tabs holding the movement.  
5. Lift the movement carefully into your holder — **dial side up**.

### 3. Remove hands and dial
- Set hands to 12:00, protect dial, and lift gently using hand levers.  
- Now that the movement is free from the case, you can easily reach the **dial foot screws** (usually on the side of the mainplate).  
- Loosen both a turn or two and lift the dial away.  
- Note the motion-works layout beneath the dial.
### 4. Disassemble train side
1. Let down the mainspring power (use crown slowly with a pin in the click).  
2. Remove balance cock and balance assembly.  
3. Remove pallet bridge and pallet fork.  
4. Remove train bridge, then wheels in order (center, third, fourth, escape).  
5. Remove barrel bridge and barrel.

### 5. Disassemble keyless works
- Remove setting lever spring, clutch, winding pinion, and stem.  
- Keep screws grouped by bridge.

### 6. Reassembly (dry)
- Reverse the order.  
- Do not oil yet.  
- Verify that the train spins freely under minimal power.  
- Refit balance and see if it starts spontaneously.

## 🧮 Data Collection
| Position   | Rate (s/day) | Amplitude (°) | Beat Error (ms) |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| Dial Up    |              |               |                 |
| Dial Down  |              |               |                 |
| Crown Down |              |               |                 |

Compute average rate and Δ (max–min).

## 🧠 Reflection
- Which screws were most confusing?  
- Did any pivots bind?  
- What surprised you about gear freedom when mainspring tension was gone?  
- Did it run again after reassembly?

- [ ] Pre- and post-teardown photos attached  
- [ ] Timegrapher readings recorded  
- [ ] Balance runs freely after reassembly  
- [ ] All screws accounted for  
- [ ] Reflection notes added
