# A3 – Date Mechanisms

## 🎯 Objective
Understand and service simple date mechanisms.  
Learn how date jumpers, calendar wheels, and correctors interact, and how to reinstall them without damage.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Materials
- Movement holder  
- Fine tweezers  
- Screwdrivers  
- Rodico  
- Loupe or microscope  
- Dial protector  
- Toothpick or pegwood for tensioning springs  
- Moebius 9010 and 9501  
- Patience

## ⚙️ System Overview

Most mid-century and modern date movements use one of two types:
1. **Instant-change** (date snaps at midnight via tensioned jumper)
2. **Semi-instant or creeping** (gradual advance over ~3 hours)

You’ll likely see a **date driving wheel**, **date jumper spring**, and **date disk** sitting over a **calendar plate**.

---

## 🧩 Disassembly Steps
1. **Remove dial and hands** (you already know this from A1).  
2. **Observe before touching anything!**  
   - Photograph the date disk and the jumper’s resting position.  
3. **Lift the date disk** carefully; don’t bend it.  
4. **Remove jumper spring and tension plate**.  
5. **Inspect teeth on the driving wheel**—look for wear or gunk.  
6. **Clean all parts** in your solvent routine (Ronsonol bath; avoid One-Dip here).

## 🧴 Lubrication Points
| Component | Lubricant | Application |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| Date disk underside | trace 9501 | Light smear where it rides the plate |
| Jumper tip | 9501 | Micro drop where it slides |
| Date driving wheel pivot | 9010 | Small dot |
| Setting lever (if quickset) | 9501 | Film on sliding face |
| Corrector pusher (if applicable) | 9501 | Film on stem contact |

---

## 🔧 Reassembly Steps
1. Fit driving wheel and jumper first.  
2. Position jumper under light tension against the date wheel.  
3. Set date disk carefully, aligning tooth with driving finger.  
4. Test advancement by hand-turning the motion works.  
5. Observe smooth jump near midnight—no binding or overshoot.  
6. Reinstall dial and hands; confirm date flips at/near 12:00.

## 🧮 Data Collection
| Test | Result |
|------|---------|
| Midnight jump time |  |
| Jump smoothness (1–5) |  |
| Quickset operation |  |
| Hand clearance check |  |

---

## 🧠 Reflection
- Did the jumper spring fly off? (Mark that zone “tweezer danger zone.”)  
- How did the date feel before/after cleaning?  
- Did the hand clearance change after reinstalling dial?  
- Any difference between instant and creeping types?  

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist
- [ ] Calendar photographed before disassembly  
- [ ] Jumper spring orientation documented  
- [ ] All calendar parts cleaned and lubricated  
- [ ] Date changes cleanly at 12:00 ± 10 min  
- [ ] Hands clear over date window  
- [ ] Reflection notes added
