# A2 ‚Äì Cleaning and Lubrication

## üéØ Objective
Clean, inspect, and lubricate your manual-wind movement using household-safe solvents and proper oiling technique.  
Learn how to handle flammable fluids safely, identify friction points, and oil precisely.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Materials
- **Ronsonol** (main cleaning and rinse)  
- **Naphtha (hardware-store)** (optional pre-soak for heavy grime)  
- **Isopropyl alcohol (99%)** (final moisture displacement rinse)  
- **One-Dip** (for pallet fork, balance, and hairspring)  
- Small glass jars (3) or baskets with lids  
- Tweezers, blower, Rodico, pegwood  
- Moebius lubricants:  
  - 9010 (train & balance pivots)  
  - 9501 / 1300 (keyless works, cannon pinion)  
  - 8200 (barrel arbor grease)  
- Oiler set (fine, medium, broad)  
- Loupe or microscope (10√ó for checking pivots and oil spread)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Solvent Safety
- Always work in a **well-ventilated area**.  
- Keep **away from open flame, heaters, or soldering irons**.  
- Use **nitrile gloves**; naphtha and IPA remove skin oils.  
- Label all jars clearly and keep One-Dip separate.  

---

## üß© Cleaning Workflow

### Stage 1 ‚Äî Pre-clean
- Wipe plates and bridges gently with Rodico.  
- Brush away visible debris with a soft brush.

### Stage 2 ‚Äî Solvent Sequence

| Jar | Fluid | Purpose | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Ronsonol | **Main cleaning bath** | Agitate parts gently 5‚Äì10 min. Brush stubborn grime. |
| 2 | Fresh Ronsonol | **Rinse** | 2‚Äì3 min soak, swish lightly. |
| 3 | IPA (99%) | **Final rinse / moisture chaser** | 20‚Äì40 sec dip only. Blot and air-dry with puffer. |
| ‚Äî | One-Dip | **Hairspring, pallet, balance** | 5‚Äì10 sec dip, air-dry. Use last and keep sealed. |

- **Never heat or blow-dry One-Dip**; it evaporates instantly.  
- Peg jewel holes clean until pegwood exits spotless.  
- Inspect pivots and jewels under magnification before reassembly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lubrication Map

| Component | Lubricant | Application |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| Balance cap jewels | 9010 | Tiny dome on cap center |
| Escape wheel pivots | 9010 | Small dot per pivot |
| Train pivots | 9010 | Minimal dot‚Äîavoid flooding |
| Center wheel lower | 9020 (optional) | Slightly heavier if accessible |
| Pallet stones | None / trace 9415 | Only if shellac stable |
| Cannon pinion bore | 9501 / 1300 | Light smear inside |
| Keyless gears | 9501 | Thin film on teeth/posts |
| Barrel arbor & hole | 8200 | Thin coat |
| Click & click spring | 9501 | Film only |
| Setting lever spring | 9501 | Tiny dab on pivots |

---

## üîß Reassembly & Testing
1. Assemble as in A1.  
2. Check train freedom before pallet fork.  
3. Once the balance is fitted, add one click of power ‚Äî it should start instantly.  
4. Wind fully, observe amplitude and beat on Weishi 1900.

## üßÆ Data Collection
| Position | Rate (s/day) | Amplitude (¬∞) | Beat Error (ms) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Dial Up |   |   |   |
| Dial Down |   |   |   |
| Crown Down |   |   |   |

## üß† Reflection
- Did Ronsonol leave any residue?  
- Did One-Dip improve hairspring motion?  
- How much oil did each pivot actually take?  
- Was your amplitude gain consistent?  

---

## ‚úÖ Submission Checklist
- [ ] Parts fully cleaned and dry  
- [ ] Jewel holes pegged clean  
- [ ] One-Dip used for balance/pallet only  
- [ ] Oiling map followed  
- [ ] Timegrapher readings recorded  
- [ ] Reflection notes completed
