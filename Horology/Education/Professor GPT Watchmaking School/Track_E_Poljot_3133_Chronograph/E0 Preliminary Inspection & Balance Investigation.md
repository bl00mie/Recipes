### Objectives
- Confirm power state without winding.
- Inspect hairspring deformation.
- Assess whether barrel is under tension.

### Steps
1. **Visual survey**
   - Photograph dial, movement, pusher alignment.
   - Note position of balance spring and regulator pins.

2. **Check for residual power**
   - Observe gear train through the chrono bridge cutouts.
   - Gently nudge the escape wheel:  
     • If it bounces → barrel partially wound.  
     • If dead still → likely safe (mainspring relaxed).

3. **Do NOT attempt to release click**
   - The 3133 click is hidden under the chrono bridge.  
   - Leave power as-is until E2 when you remove the chrono layer.

4. **Inspect hairspring**
   - Under 10–20×, confirm whether outer coil passes between regulator pins.
   - Document if coils are off-center or touching.

5. **Storage**
   - Secure in dust-tight case labeled *“Unwound / unknown power”*.
