### Objectives
- Straighten displaced outer coils.
- Center spring in regulator pins.
- Adjust beat error.

### Tools
Hairspring tweezers, balance tack, stereo microscope (20×), demagnetizer.

### Procedure
1. Mount balance on tack, hairspring upward.  
2. Identify outer coil path. If outside regulator, unpin stud and reposition.  
3. If coils lean sideways, correct using parallel tweezers—minute, alternating pressure.  
4. Check concentricity: blow gently; coils should breathe evenly.  
5. Demagnetize only after geometry is correct.  
6. Reinstall, adjust beat by rotating collet on staff (minimal movement).  
7. Re-test on timegrapher in all six positions.
