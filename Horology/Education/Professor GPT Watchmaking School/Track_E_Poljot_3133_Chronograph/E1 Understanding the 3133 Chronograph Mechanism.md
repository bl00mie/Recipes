## E1 – Understanding the 3133 Chronograph Mechanism

### Goal
Before any disassembly, build mental and visual understanding of **every chrono subsystem**.

### Subsystems Overview
| Subsystem | Components | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Operating lever system** | Start/stop lever, operating cam, operating lever spring | Translates pusher action into motion for clutch + hammer |
| **Coupling clutch** | Coupling yoke, driving wheel, intermediate chrono wheel | Engages/disengages the chrono train with the 4th wheel |
| **Chronograph train** | Chrono center wheel, minute recording wheel, intermediate wheel | Drives recording hands |
| **Reset system** | Heart cams (on chrono center & minute wheels), hammer, hammer spring | Returns chrono hands to zero |
| **Blocking system** | Brake lever, blocking lever, return spring | Prevents accidental movement during reset |
| **Click & winding** | Hidden under chrono bridge | Provides winding lock to barrel |
| **Base movement** | Standard going train (barrel → center → 3rd → 4th → escape) | Timekeeping |

### Exercises
1. Print or sketch the movement. Label each lever and spring.  
2. Watch slow-motion videos of the 3133 start/stop/reset cycle.  
3. Use a cocktail stick to trace how motion travels:  
   pusher → operating cam → clutch → chrono wheel → heart → hammer.

4. Note how the **click** and **barrel arbor** are completely under the chrono bridge — critical when planning safe depowering.
