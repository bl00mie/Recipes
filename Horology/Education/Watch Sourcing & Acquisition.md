| **2. Resell Potential** | Working or restorable vintage mechanicals. | eBay, Mercari, Facebook Marketplace, watch forums | $30–$150 |
| **3. Collector / Flip** | Desirable vintage models or chronographs with good resale upside. | Chrono24, Reddit r/Watchexchange, regional watch fairs | $150–$800+ |
| **4. Parts / Donors** | Movements or incomplete watches for parts harvesting. | CousinsUK, eBay “parts only” lots, old jeweler estates | $10–$50 |

## 🧾 Negotiation & Buying Notes
- Message sellers about **non-working watches** — often they’ll drop price if you offer to take it “for repair or parts.”  
- **Lowball kindly.** Vintage sellers expect negotiation, especially on Marketplace and Mercari.  
- Ask for **movement photos** before buying. If they won’t open the back, assume rust.  
- Avoid “battery corrosion” listings — usually trashed quartz.  
- Look for **“balance swings freely”** or **“ticks briefly”** — great signs for restoration potential.  
- Save “Search Alerts” in eBay for every caliber you target.
