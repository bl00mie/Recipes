### Summary
Custom Gridfinity-based stacking tray system sized for existing wicker drawers in office storage.  
Each tray includes an integral Gridfinity baseplate and inset bottom for secure stacking.  
Color-coded trays indicate watch status (organ donor, keeper, flipper, etc.).  
**Printer-limited to a 256 mm build area, so trays use a 6Ã—4-cell footprint.**
